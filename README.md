ðŸŽ“ Eternal student... \
I'm a Veterinary Doctor, with a Master's and a PhD by Universidade Federal de GoiÃ¡s (UFG), but I'm also doing my second graduation in Computer Science!\
Strange, isn't it? Yeah, I'm aware of that...

# My main experiences:

### Academically ðŸŽ“ 
During my Master's and PhD. in Animal Science, I developed some apps that used neural networks aiming to assist the veterinarian on executing laboratory tests, considering the A.C.E principle (<b>Agility</b>; <b>Comfort</b>; <b>Expansivity</b>).



### Personal projects: :rage1:
I like games, but more than playing I like game development. I've already used popular Game Engines like GameMaker and Unity. I also played a little with some Frameworks such as Monogame in order to understand how the game flow works behind the curtains. 
I've studied Game Engine development, and as a "bonus", I also had to study computer maths, computer graphics, shader languages and many other subjects attached to the Game Engine development field of study!
